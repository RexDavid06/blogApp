### Static & Media Files

- Static files are served from the `static/` directory.
- Uploaded profile pictures are stored in `media/profile_pictures/`.
- Ensure you have set the following in `settings.py` for development:
  ```python
  STATIC_URL = '/static/'
  MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
  MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
  ```
- In development, add this to your root `urls.py`:
  ```python
  from django.conf import settings
  from django.conf.urls.static import static

  urlpatterns = [
      # ... your URL patterns ...
  ] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
  ```

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains Django app with models, views, templates, and static files
- `templates/`: HTML templates for rendering pages
- `static/`: CSS and static assets
- `media/`: Uploaded images (profile pictures)

## Customization

- Update `style.css` in the `static/` directory to change the blogâ€™s appearance
- Extend the `Profile` model or blog post model for more features
